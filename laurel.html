            <h3>The project</h3>
            <p>People are eager to achieve their goals, but there is a world of distance between simply setting a goal and actually following through on a plan to reach it. Despite the difficulty, the desire for personal development is sometimes strong enough to reach the finish line, but it is often hard to self-motivate. Especially in the bustle of the modern world, people are looking for resources to support them to make progress towards their goals. This is evidenced by the several billion dollar industry that has emerged for personal development products, which is projected to continue growing over the next decade (Personal development market size, 2022).</p>
            <p>However, beyond realizing the market opportunity, our team wanted to develop an application that truly improves the lives of our users. Scientific research has linked the pursuit and attainment of both intrinsic and extrinsic goals to improved overall well-being (Tóth, 2018). This evidence further encouraged our team to pursue the development of what became Laurel, a goal-setting and goal-achieving app.</p>
            <p>We aimed for our app to work by assisting the user to set goals with specific time horizons and commitments associated with them, leveraging AI to recommend a goal plan and metrics that will help the user work towards and track their goal. Users can sync their goal plans to their calendars and edit them as needed. There would also be a social aspect to Laurel where users could connect with others that are pursuing similar goals.</p>

                <div id="right">
                    <p>We used three well-rounded user personas and associated empathy maps that visualized the users’ behaviors and attitudes to provide a better understanding of what our target audience would look like.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Johanna represents university students. The latter normally have many assignments and due dates, making it hard for them to balance between social life and personal goals.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Henry represents health conscious people. These people may need help managing a disability or reaching wellness goals. Both scenarios require time consuming and detailed activities that are difficult to schedule for and keep track of.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Laura represents parents. They may experience trouble managing their time between their children and careers.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

            </div>
            <h4>Interviews</h4>
            <p>Once we determined our target audience, we conducted user interviews to learn about our intended users’ backgrounds and goals. We recruited individuals matching the university student persona and the parent persona however, we had difficulty finding someone to match the health-conscious persona. Instead, we interviewed a working professional for our third interview as an equally likely target user.</p>
            <p>There were three high-level aspects that we wanted to explore through the interviews: users’ experience with goal setting and goal achievement, opinions about goal setting and planning aspects of our app, and opinions on the accountability and motivation aspects of our product.</p>
            <p>The results of the interviews gave us some insights on which direction to take our app design to achieve highest user satisfaction and also uncovered our incorrect assumptions about users. For instance, we initially planned to incorporate a feature that allowed users to share their goal progress to external apps as we expected people to feel motivated doing so. However, the interviews revealed less interest in this feature than expected.</p>
            <p>We used an affinity diagram to categorize the key insights from the interviews. We arrived at five main sections: features and specifications wanted in a goal setting app, current difficulties experienced with goal setting, types of goal users track or want to track, current approaches to goals setting, and concerns or comments on the sharing aspect.</p>

            <h3>Design Iterations</h3>
            <p>As part of the ideation stage, we arrived at four features we deemed most important to explore for our app:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Goal sharing</b>(sharing milestones on social media platforms)</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Goal breakdown</b> (automatically generating subgoals)</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Reminders</b></p></li>
                <li><p><b>Progress tracking</b> (via metrics)</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>For each feature, we drew sketches, designed a storyboard, and user flow diagrams. Below are the artifacts from the feature I personally worked on: Progress Tracking.</p>

            </div>
            
            <h4>Wireframing</h4>
            <p>The next step was for us to create our wireframes. I included the finalized wireframe we arrived at for the feature I worked on. In the process of transitioning from paper to digital, the feature was broken down into two steps for the user to choose from a list of AI suggested metrics or add a custom metric, and to choose their preferred display style. There was also the addition of a Goal Details page for the user to see the newly added information.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <h4>Low-Fidelity Protoyping</h4>
            <p>After developing our Low-Fidelity prototype, we developed a test plan to conduct two user tests of our low-fidelity prototypes. To expose our users to the entire breadth of UI for both features and to create a realistic user experience, we designed two user testing tasks surrounding a weight loss goal. These tasks provided the necessary input required to visit all screens and matched our users’ interests in setting fitness related goals mentioned in user interviews. These interviews informed our design decisions when moving onto the next step: High-Fidelity prototyping.</p>

            <h4>High-Fidelity Protoyping</h4>
            <p>In the high-fidelity iteration of our design, we made the user suggested changes previously mentioned. We also added color-coded tags to show error messages and indicate success or failure of user actions. Additionally, upon analyzing our low-fidelity prototype from the lens of Gestalt principles and conventional mobile navigation patterns, we felt the Goals List and the Goal Details pages of the app needed to be redesigned to create better visual structure.</p>
            <p>As part of the redesign of the Goals List page, we changed the page title to My Goals for personalization, and reduced the amount of information in individual goal cards to give the design more breathing room. We also removed the hamburger navigation with the rationale that our app did not require many navigation options. Instead, we made information components on the screen directly interactive and housed any remaining settings with the addition of a profile icon and profile functionality.</p>
            <p>insert img</p>
            <p>As part of the redesign of the Goals Detail page, we changed the page title to reflect the theme of the associated goal (e.g. Weight Loss). Additionally, we felt including all the information related to a goal on a single page was too crowded. Thus, we separated the different categories of information onto separate pages and we added a sticky tab bar to allow the user to navigate between the different categories. We kept the landing page/Goals List page accessible from the Goal Details page by adding a home icon in the screen header.</p>
            <p>insert img</p>
            <p>In addition to functional design changes, we also focused heavily on stylistic decisions at this stage. We created a design system with a dedicated colour scheme, typography and UI components to form the branding of our app. We chose a more rounded font, components with rounded edges, and colors such as blue and purple and grey to create a less aggressive and softer aesthetic. We used negative spacing, symmetry, and varying font sizes to create a visual structure that conveyed the intended information grouping on screens. This design intends to make the task of goal setting less daunting.</p>
            <p>The figure below shows the initial version of our high-fidelity prototype with the aforementioned changes and design decisions.</p>
            <p>insert img</p>
            <p>To evaluate the usability of our high-fidelity prototype and our design assumptions, we conducted two heuristic evaluations and a cognitive walkthrough.</p>
            <p>For the heuristic evaluation, we instructed the evaluators to focus on the following Nielsen heuristics in their evaluation: visibility of system status, user control and freedom, consistency and standards, error prevention, and aesthetic and minimal design.</p>
            <p>For both evaluations, we used the two user tasks from the low-fidelity prototype user tests and a new login task as three-scenario based tasks for the evaluations. These tasks were used as they targeted the core functionality of the app and exposed evaluators to all its screens, allowing them to conduct a complete aesthetic and functional evaluation.</p>
            <p>To summarize the evaluation results, three main concerns were highlighted across both evaluations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>First, evaluators found user feedback to indicate the completion of the step was missing from some steps and in the Add Goal feature. This made it unclear for the users if they could progress to the next step or in the final step, they could not confirm their selections before completing the Add Goal process.</p></li>
                <li><p>Second, users found we violated the consistency and standards heuristic because our use of different navigation approaches across features. For some evaluators it was not clear the home icon was used to navigate back to the landing page from the Goal Details page, and others found the use of different kinds of ‘Back’ and ‘Next’ buttons across features created a confusing user experience.</p></li>
                <li><p>Third, the evaluators found that presenting the progress metric options for the user to select in both features with checkboxes was misleading as this implied the option was multi-select but our current implementation only allowed the selection of one option.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Final Design</h3>
            <p>In response to the results from our high-fidelity prototype evaluations, we made a number of modifications to arrive at the final iteration of our design aside from minor cosmetic and aesthetic fixes.</p>
            <p>We removed the blended navigation pattern in our design to restore navigational consistency across features. The Add Goal feature now displays its Back and Next or Done buttons in the screen header which is consistent with the New Metric feature. Also, the Next or Done buttons only appear once the user finishes entering input or appear immediately when a step is optional to give clear user feedback that a step is complete and so the user has the freedom to confirm their inputs/selections before the user can progress to the next step. Also, to align with design standards for selectable options, any single-select options in the Add Goal or New Metric feature that were previously using checkboxes have been replaced with radio buttons.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the profile icon now appears on all screens of the app (except the Add Goal feature to indicate the app is in a special state at that stage), and it replaces the home icon on the Goal Details page. To replace the functionality of the home icon, the tab bar has been updated to include a ‘Home’ option for improved user control and freedom, and also to remove features not implemented in this iteration of our prototype for more minimal design.</p>
            <p>Some screens from the complete prototype with mentioned changes are shown below. However, a detailed walkthrough of the entire final high-fidelity prototype can be found in this video demo, here.</p>

            <h3>Reflections</h3>
            <p>Working through the design thinking process we gained several insights about user assumptions and design principles.</p>
            <p>For example, during user interviews in the Empathize phase we were surprised to learn that users did not have much interest in sharing their goals and progress with their peers even though this is a crucial part of effective goal setting. Hence we discovered that while scientific theory gives the best framework for the processes you want to design in your product, as a designer you cannot assume that users preferences and desired behavior will align with the ideal scenario. Instead, you must be open to and be prepared to adapt your design to actual user feedback. Additionally, during the prototyping process we were surprised to see that our blended navigation pattern created more confusion for users rather than the clear user experience we intended. We learned that although we are in a technology driven age where the general population are avid technology users, not every user interface is immediately intuitive. Thus, it is crucial for effective design to rely on sound design principles such as the use of signifiers and Gestalt principles to create visual structure and user flows that is consistent with their assumptions about user interface and results in the intended interactions.</p>
            <p>Reflecting on the limitations of our design, we realize we still have not discovered a design approach or feature that would make it enjoyable for users to share their goals and goal process with other users. In our opinion, incorporating a feature that creates a community aspect would be beneficial for our app as it would increase exposure and engagement, and it allows a better chance of success to achieve their goals, which would increase user satisfaction. Overall, our vision is that Laurel will not only help people with the schedule and management aspect of goal planning but also improves users’ self-confidence and productivity by increasing their consistency and effectiveness in achieving their goals. Once they realize their capabilities, we hope this would allow users to improve themselves and the world around them.</p>
